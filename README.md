# SimpleMCLoader
When loading a plugin this is what will show when it is enabled/disabled in console - Build for game version 1.8.8 (1.7 Works too)
I didn't make it so that you can edit in a config.yml as I am not bothered so you have to edit the the bootup message via the SRC * Fork it 

If the plugin doesn't work or an issue appears to exist make an issue and I will fix it as quick as possible
